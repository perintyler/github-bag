const CLEAN_COMMIT_PROMPT = `You are rewriting the commit history on a feature branch to be clean and logical.

## Your Task

1. **Analyze the branch**: Run git commands to understand what branch you're on, what the base branch is (main or master), and what commits exist since the branch diverged. Look at the full diff to understand the changes.

2. **Create a backup**: Before any destructive operation, create a backup branch named \`backup/<current-branch>/<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>\` so the user can recover.

3. **Plan logical commits**: Group the changes into 2-5 logical commits. Each commit should represent a coherent unit of work. Order them logically: infrastructure/setup first, then features, then fixes. Config changes go with the feature they support. Tests go with the code they test.

4. **Execute the rewrite**:
   - \`git reset --soft <merge-base>\` to collapse all commits but keep changes staged
   - \`git reset HEAD .\` to unstage everything
   - For each logical commit group: stage the relevant files with \`git add\`, then \`git commit -m "message"\`
   - After all commits, check \`git status\` — if any files were missed, stage and commit them as "chore: remaining changes"

5. **Report results**: At the end, output a summary in this exact JSON format (wrapped in a \`\`\`json code block):

\`\`\`json
{
  "backupBranch": "backup/my-branch/2026-03-12T10-30-00",
  "originalCommitCount": 7,
  "commits": [
    {"message": "Add GitHub webhook receiver", "files": ["servers/github/src/index.ts", "servers/github/package.json"]},
    {"message": "Configure routing and launchd service", "files": ["config/Caddyfile", "launchd/com.barry.github.plist"]}
  ],
  "baseBranch": "master"
}
\`\`\`

## Rules

- NEVER force push — the CLI wrapper handles that
- NEVER modify files — only use git commands to reorganize existing commits
- If there's only 1 commit on the branch, report that and stop (nothing to clean)
- If the working tree is dirty (uncommitted changes), report that and stop
- Use \`git add <file>\` for specific files, never \`git add -A\` except for leftover cleanup
- Commit messages should be concise but descriptive — explain the "what"
- Every changed file must end up in exactly one commit
{{PUSH_INSTRUCTION}}`;

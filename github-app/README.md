Barry's GitHub App — a small Express server that receives GitHub webhook events and handles OAuth callbacks.

---

**What it does:** Verifies webhook signatures (HMAC-SHA256), logs incoming events, and processes OAuth code exchange for a single allowed GitHub user. Currently the webhook handler logs but does not act on events.

**Used by:** Runs as a standalone service (`github-app`) on a configured port.

**Assessment:** Currently minimal — the webhook handler is a stub (just logs and returns 200). Could be removed or left dormant until GitHub-triggered automation is implemented. The OAuth callback is only useful if GitHub OAuth integration is active.
